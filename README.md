KEES: Knowledge Exchange Engine Schema 
=======================================

**WARNING: WORKING IN PROGRESS**

In order to let computers to work for us, they must understand data: 
not just the grammar and the syntax but the real meaning of things. 

KEES proposes some specifications to add metadata to a *domain knowledge* in order to make it tradeable and shareable. 
Artificial Intelligences and humans can use KEES to populate, merge, exchange and enrich such knowledge. KEES is a Semantic Web Application.

To trade a *domain knowledge* means to be able to license information about how to:

- collect the right data, 
- trust in the data quality, 
- reasonings about collected data
- answer somain specific questions

See [KEES project presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mv9XO0Q9QFxSphWzT_68Q4aXd9sgqWoY7njomH8eaPQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000)

## Core KEES concepts

Lot of concepts used by KEES refer to the well known [Semantic Web Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) published by the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](https://w3.org/)).

What is **data**? According with common sense, KEES defines data as words, numbers or in general *any string of symbols*.  This concept is equivalent to the definition of "literal" in the [RDF] (Resource Data Framework). Example of data is the string  `xyz`, the numbers `123`, `33.22` or the URI `http://LinkedData.Center`. Note that the data is usually associated with a  _data type_ it is just a name that states a set of restrictions on symbols string that build up the data;  _data type_ is not the data meaning.

What is **information**? KEES defines information as *data with a meaning*. The meaning can be 
learned from the context where a data is found or explicitly defined. From a practical point of view, because KEES adopts the [RDF standards](https://www.w3.org/RDF/), an information is defined by three data that build up a _triple_ (also known as a RDF statement): a _subject_, a _predicate_ and an _object_. The data type for the first two triple elements (subject and predicate) must be an URIs subclass, the last element (object) can be any data type.

KEES defines **knowledge** as a nework of linked information (i.e. linked data). This nework is possible because, in RDF, any URI can be both the object of a triple  and the subject of another one or even a predicate for another.

KEES defines **knowledge base** (or **knowledge graph** ) as a container of *linked data with a purpose*.

From a more theoretical point of view, a knowledge base is a semantic system where information is described as a
set of statements according with the W3C standard Resource Description Framework (RDF). 

A  Knowledge Base is logically partitioned in two set of statements: *TBox* and *ABox*. *ABox statements* describe the facts,  *TBox statements* describe the terms used to qualify the facts (i.e. the vocabulary). If you are familiar with object-oriented paradigm, TBox statements sometimes associate with classes, while ABox associate with individual class instances. 
*TBox statements* tend to be more permanent within a knowledge base and are often grouped in *ontologies* that describe a specific 
knowledge domain (e.g. business entities, people, goods, friendship, offering, geocoding, etc, etc).
*ABox statements* associate with instances of classes defined by TBox statements. ABox statements are much more dynamic in nature and 
are populated from datasets available in the web or by reasonings. 

For practical purposes, KEES assumes that a knowledge base is realized with of a [SPARQL service](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/#sd-Service) with contains a default dataset composed by all RDF triples contained in a set of disjoined **Named Graphs**.

The most important concept introduced by KEES  is the **Question**. 
Questions represent the reasons for the the knowledge base existence. In other words, the knoledge base exists to answer to *questions*. Question are natural language expressions that can be expressed as parametric SPARQL queries on a populated knowledge graph. The answer to a question can be a table of data, a structured document, a boolean or a translation of these in a natural language sentences.

**Trustability** is another key concept in KEES. The [RDF] model allow to mix any kind of information, even when information that are incoerent. For instace, suppose that your TBOX defines a property "person:hasMom" that require a cardinality of 1 (i.e. every person has just one "mom"), your knowledge base could contains two different fact (:jack person:hasMom :Mary) and (:jack person:hasMom :Giulia), in order to take decision about who is jack's mom you need trust in your data. If you are sure about the veridicicy of all data in the knowledge base, you can deduct that :Mary and :Giulia are the same person. If you are not so sure, you have two possibility: choose the most trusted statement with respect some criteria (even casually if both statemenst have the same trust rank) or to change the TBOX , allowing a person to have more than one mom. In any case you need to get an idea about _your_ trust on each statement (both ABox and Tbox) in the knowlege base.

**The KEES workflow** is based on a sequence of four temporal phases called "windowsâ€œ:

- a startup  phase (**boot window**)  to initialize the knowledge base just with KEES description and TBOX statements
- a time slot for the population of the Knowledge Base and to link data (**learning window**)
- a time slot for the data inference (**reasoning window**)
- a time slot to access the Knowledge Base and answering to questions  (**teaching window**)

KEES workflow is a continuous integration process. A guard SHOULD allow user to query the knowledge base only during the teaching windows.

The **Language Profile** (or **Application profile**) is the portion of the vocabulary that describes the knowledge that is recognized by a specific software application. The language profile is normally described in the Tbox partition of a knowledge base. 

The **KEES Language Profile** is an application profile to describe the knowledge base itself, providing instructions about how
to learn facts, how to reasoning about learned informations and about how to answer to questions. It reuses terms from existing vocabularies:

- dct: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
- xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#
- qb: http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#
- sdmx-code: http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#
- daq: http://purl.org/eis/vocab/daq# 
- sd: http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql-service-description#
- kees: http://linkeddata.center/kees/v1#


The following picture sumarize mandatory restrictions introduced by the KEES language profile.

![uml](architecture/uml.png)

A **KEES compliant application** is a Semantic Web Application that is not in conflict with the KEES Language Profile. 

A **KEES Agent** is a software process that understands a portion the KEES language profile and that it is able to do actions on a 
knowledge base. For instance, it could be able to ingest data and/or to answer some questions.

Knowing the statement **provenance** is the most usefull way to get an idea about its trustability. For this reason, KEES requires that any statement must have a fourth element that links to metadata that describe any statement in the knowledge base. This means that, for pratical concerns, the KEES knowledge base is a collection of quads, i.e. a triple plus a link to a metadata.
A **Reasoning** describes rules to materialize new informations using an algoritmic approach  on existing knowledge base facts.
A reasoning should occurs when a test conditions is true and it is related to a sequence of **Inference steps** through the  property **axioms**.

An axiom describes how to generate/validate knowledge base statemensts using a declarative approach.  For instance an axiom can be represented with a sparql construct or with a SHACL restriction or with an 
entailment inferred by language profile semantic. A test condition can be realized with an ASK SPARQL operation. KEES does not impose any specification for axioms nor for condition representation.

Finnaly  **KEES configuration** is a dataset describing a knowledge base. A KEES Agent shold be able to rebuild the whole knowlege graph
just looking to the KEES configuration. Because different KEES configurations can be safely merged in a single new configuration, and this make knowledge domains shareable. Because a dataset can be protected with a license, you can sell your knowledge base (that is different to sell the data contained in the  knowlede about the data) making knowledge tradeable. 

The KEES configuration can be included in the knowledge base in the graph named <urn:kees:configuration> or kept as separate resource.

The http://linkeddata.center/kees/v1#  namespace ( usual prefix *kees:*) contains a small set of concepts, mainly derived from existing ontologies. It provides terms to describe the knowledge base metadata that a KEES complain agent SHOULD know.

KEES vocabulary defines a set of individuals:

- **kees:guard** a [SPARQL service description](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/#sd-Feature) feature that states that the RDF store supports KEES guard specifications (see below)

- **kees:trustMetric** defines a generic trust metric computed on an arbitrary requirements.

- **kees:trustGraphMetric** defines a metric that evaluate a subjective trust value for a graph with a specific name. Can be used in graph quality observations.

- **kees:sparqlQueryConstructOperation** states the datatype of a literal string containing a sparql query CONSTRUCT operation. 
- **kees:sparqlQuerySelectOperation** states the datatype of a literal string containing a sparql query SELECT operation.
- **kees:sparqlQueryDescribeOperation** states the datatype of a literal string containing a sparql query DESCRIBE operation.
- **kees:sparqlQueryAskOperation** states the datatype of a literal string containing a sparql query ASK operation.
- **kees:sparqlUpdateScript** states the datatype of a literal string containing a sparql update scrirpt.


TODO: A formal definition of kees vocabulary is availabe as a [RDFS file](v1/kees.rdf).

TODO: KEES language profile restrictions is formally expressed in [SHACL constraints file](v1/kees-profile.rdf)

## RDF Store requirement

Any RDF Store that provides with a SPARQL endpoint and QUAD support is compliant with KEES. Following requirement applies:

- If a statement with subject <urn:kees:kb> and predicate dct:valid is present in the knowledge base, this  means that the Knowledge base is in the *teaching window* windows (i.e. safe to be queried). Otherwhise the kees status of the knowledge base should be considered undefined.

For example: to declare that a RDF Store is ready to be safely queried execute following SPARQL UPDATE statement

```
INSERT { <urn:kees:kb> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/valid> ?now }
WHERE { BIND( NOW() AS ?now) }
```

to check if a RDF Store is ready to be safely queried `ASK { <urn:kees:kb> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/valid> [] }`

## SPARQL service requirements

A KEES compliant sparql endpoint SHOULD support the  **kees:guard** feature: a KEES compliant sparql endpoint SHOULD return 503 Error of any SPARQL QUERY that happens on a RDF Store that is not in the  *teaching window* state.  A KEES compliant sparql endpoint SHOULD disable this feature if the http header "X-KEES-guard: disable" is present.

A KEES compliant sparql endpoint SHOULD support http caching specs [as described in Section 13 of RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html) for all SPARQL queries that happened in the same teaching windows.

```

### TBD: simple web resource (re)loading

This states that an graph named `:example`  SHOULD exist in the knowledge base and that graph should be loaded with the content of the web resource "http://data.example.com/dataset1.ttl"

```
[]  kees:graphName <http://data.example.com/dataset1> .
```
This RDF triple is equivalent to:

```
[] a kees:Learning;
	kees:dataSource <http://data.example.com/dataset1> ;
	kees:graphName <http://data.example.com/dataset1l> ;
.
```

A KEES compliant agent implementation SHOULD check if the resource is newer 
than named graph in the knowledge base using a default accrual policy; 
if yes  it COULD upload athe resource into the graph named *http://data.example.com/dataset1l* using a default accrual Methods


### The accrual periodicity

A KEES compliant agent should take into account accrual periodicity. e.g:

```
[] a kees:Learning;;
	kees:graphName <http://data.example.com/dataset1l> ;
	dct:accrualPeriodicity sdmx-code:freq-W
.
```

A KEES agent implementation SHOULD recognize at frequency instance in  
the [Content-Oriented Guidelines Frq schema](http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/code#freq) 
developed as part of the W3C Data Cube Vocabulary efforts. 


### adding trust info

Trust in dataset can be expessed with:

```
[] a qb:Observation ;
    daq:computedOn (:a_graph schema:LocalBusiness schema:legalName) ; 
    daq:metric kees:trustMetric ;
    daq:value 0.99 ;
    daq:isEstimated true .
```

or

```
[] a qb:Observation ;
    daq:computedOn :a_graph ; 
    daq:metric kees:trustGraphMetric;
    daq:value 0.9 ;
    daq:isEstimated true .
```

If no explicit observation records are present in the knowledge base, this axiom SHOULD applies:

```
CONSTRUCT {
   [] a qb:Observation ;
      daq:computedOn ?g ; 
      daq:metric kees:trustGraphMetric;
      daq:value 0.5 ;
      daq:isEstimated true .
} WHERE {
      ?g sd:name ?name ;
      FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?observation daq:computedOn ?g  }
}
```


### simple reasoning

This states that a some Infereces SHOULD created if the knowledge base is not empty 

```
[] a kees:Reasoning ;
	kees:when [ kees:test "ASK ?s ?p ?o"^^kees:sparqlQueryAskOperation ]
	kees:accrualMethod (
		"Drop all triples in inferred named graph"@en 
		"Evaluate skos axioms"@en
	)
.

```

Note that in this case a KEES Agent that the able to understand the accrual method text is required to perform these inferences.
